fix: |
  A devicetree node reference in your C code points to a node/alias
  that doesn't exist in the final merged DTS. This covers DT_ALIAS(),
  DT_NODELABEL(), DEVICE_DT_GET(), and similar macros.
  Fix: Read the board DTS definition to find the correct alias or
  node label. Check:
    1. The board base DTS: boards/<vendor>/<board>/<board>.dts
    2. Your overlay: boards/<board_qualifier>.overlay
    3. The aliases { } block in either file
  Common causes:
  - The alias simply doesn't exist on this board (e.g. sw0 on boards
    with no user button). Fix: add the node + alias in your overlay.
  - Alias name mismatch: DTS uses hyphens, C macros use underscores:
      DTS:  led-strip = &led_strip;
      C:    DT_ALIAS(led_strip)
  - Overlay not picked up (wrong board qualifier in filename)
context: "Generic DTS ordinal error. Covers missing aliases (sw0, led-strip, etc.) and missing node labels."
