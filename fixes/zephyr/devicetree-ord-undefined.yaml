  Missing or mismatched node reference in devicetree overlay.
  The overlay file references a node ordinal that does not exist
  in the base board DTS. Common causes:
  1. Pin numbering changed between board revisions or SoC families
  2. The overlay was written for a different board variant
  3. The base DTS was updated but the overlay was not
  Check the node path in the DTS output and verify the ordinal
  exists. For Nordic chips, compare nRF52840 vs nRF54L15 pin maps.
